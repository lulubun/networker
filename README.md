<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Inspired by my need to manage the many contacts I have made and will make in the tech community, this app is modeled after CRM (customer relationship management) software that I have used in the past in sales.</p>
<p>This is a simple way to keep track of contact information for networking contacts and a way to schedule continuing follow-ups so you don't lose track of them. An add to calendar feature is included that adds an appointment to your personal calendar to follow up with a contact.</p>
<p>This app includes the ability to create an individual account and secure login. The demo account is available for browsing the site without registering.</p>
